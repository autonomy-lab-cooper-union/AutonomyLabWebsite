      <description>Objective We are envisioning a Cooper-based center for autonomous and connected vehicles in smart cities. This center will focus on two main objectives:
 Development of new technologies that contribute to sustainable and resilient transport systems ​ Creation and development of a multidisciplinary educational model that teaches students the concepts of autonomous vehicles using real-world customized cars. ​  Governors Island has been identified as a likely location for both performing research and educational activities involving real-world autonomous cars.</description>
