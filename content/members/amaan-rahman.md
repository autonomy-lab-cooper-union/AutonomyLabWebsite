I research convolution neural networks for solving pose estimation problems with low-cost systems; I apply my research in virtual reality, computer animation, and exoskeleton performance analysis. I enjoy programming, playing video games, riding my bike, playing cricket and basketball, and not sleeping when I get the chance.
